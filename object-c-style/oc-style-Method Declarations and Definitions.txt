One space should be used between the - or + and the return type, and no spacing in the parameter list except between parameters.
Methods should look like this:

- (void)doSomethingWithString:(NSString *)theString {
  ...
}
The spacing before the asterisk is optional. When adding new code, be consistent with the surrounding file's style.

If you have too many parameters to fit on one line, giving each its own line is preferred. If multiple lines are used, align each using the colon before the parameter.

- (void)doSomethingWith:(GTMFoo *)theFoo
                   rect:(NSRect)theRect
               interval:(float)theInterval {
  ...
}
When the first keyword is shorter than the others, indent the later lines by at least four spaces, maintaining colon alignment:

- (void)short:(GTMFoo *)theFoo
          longKeyword:(NSRect)theRect
    evenLongerKeyword:(float)theInterval
                error:(NSError **)theError {
  ...
}
