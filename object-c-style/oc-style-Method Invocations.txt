Method invocations should be formatted much like method declarations. When there's a choice of formatting styles, follow the convention already used in a given source file.
Invocations should have all arguments on one line:

[myObject doFooWith:arg1 name:arg2 error:arg3];
or have one argument per line, with colons aligned:

[myObject doFooWith:arg1
               name:arg2
              error:arg3];
			  
-----------------------------------------------------
错误的格式
Don't use any of these styles:

[myObject doFooWith:arg1 name:arg2  // some lines with >1 arg
              error:arg3];

[myObject doFooWith:arg1
               name:arg2 error:arg3];

[myObject doFooWith:arg1
          name:arg2  // aligning keywords instead of colons
          error:arg3];

-----------------------------------------------------
As with declarations and definitions, when the first keyword is shorter than the others, indent the later lines by at least four spaces, maintaining colon alignment:

[myObj short:arg1
          longKeyword:arg2
    evenLongerKeyword:arg3
                error:arg4];
Invocations containing inlined blocks may have their segments left-aligned at a four space indent.
