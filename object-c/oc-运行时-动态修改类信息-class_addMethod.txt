Adds a new method to a class with a given name and implementation.

BOOL class_addMethod ( Class cls, SEL name, IMP imp, const char *types );

Return Value
YES if the method was added successfully, otherwise NO 
(for example, the class already contains a method implementation with that name).

Discussion
class_addMethod will add an override of a superclass's implementation, but will not replace an existing implementation in this class. To change an existing implementation, use method_setImplementation.

An Objective-C method is simply a C function that take at least two arguments—self and _cmd. For example, given the following function:

void myMethodIMP(id self, SEL _cmd)
{
    // implementation ....
}
you can dynamically add it to a class as a method (called resolveThisMethodDynamically) like this:

class_addMethod([self class], @selector(resolveThisMethodDynamically), (IMP) myMethodIMP, "v@:");

This chapter describes how you can provide an implementation of a method dynamically
