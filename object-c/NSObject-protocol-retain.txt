You send an object a retain message 
when you want to prevent it from being deallocated until you have finished using it.

An object is deallocated automatically when its reference count reaches 0. 
retain messages increment the reference count, and 
release messages decrement it.

As a convenience, retain returns self because it may be used in nested expressions

You would implement this method only if you were defining your own reference-counting scheme. 
Such implementations must return self and should not invoke the inherited method by sending a retain message to super.
