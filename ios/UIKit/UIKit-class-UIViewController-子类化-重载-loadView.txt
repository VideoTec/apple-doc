Creates the view that the controller manages

- (void)loadView

You should never call this method directly. The view controller calls this method when its view property is requested but is currently nil. This method loads or creates a view and assigns it to the view property.

If the view controller has an associated nib file, this method loads the view from the nib file. A view controller has an associated nib file if the nibName property returns a non-nil value, which occurs if the view controller was instantiated from a storyboard, if you explicitly assigned it a nib file using the initWithNibName:bundle: method, or if iOS finds a nib file in the app bundle with a name based on the view controller's class name. If the view controller does not have an associated nib file, this method creates a plain UIView object instead.

If you use Interface Builder to create your views and initialize the view controller, you must not override this method.

You can override this method in order to create your views manually. If you choose to do so, assign the root view of your view hierarchy to the view property. The views you create should be unique instances and should not be shared with any other view controller object. Your custom implementation of this method should not call super.

If you want to perform any additional initialization of your views, do so in the viewDidLoad method.

[super loadView]的效果，应该就是产生了一个有效的view，也就是一个空白的view
