View Event Notification

The UIViewController class automatically responds to many notifications, 
such as 
when the view controller's view is added to or removed from a window's view hierarchy or 
when it is resized. 

The UIViewController class provides specific methods that are called when these events occur. 
Subclasses can override these methods to implement specific behaviors.
