UIResponder

The UIApplication class 
provides a centralized point of control and coordination for apps running on iOS. 
Every app must have exactly one instance of UIApplication (or a subclass of UIApplication). 
每个应用 对应 一个UIApplication实例

singleton[英][ˈsɪŋgltən] [美][ˈsɪŋɡəltən]
n.一个，独身，单独
When an app is launched, the UIApplicationMain function is called; 
among its other tasks, this function creates a singleton UIApplication object. 
Thereafter you access this object by invoking the sharedApplication class method.

A major role of a UIApplication object is to handle the initial routing of incoming user events. 
It also dispatches action messages forwarded to it 
by control objects (UIControl) to the appropriate target objects. 
In addition, the UIApplication object maintains 
a list of all the windows (UIWindow objects) currently open in the app, 
so through those it can retrieve any of the app’s UIView objects. 

UIApplicationDelegate 代理接口
The app object is typically assigned a delegate, 
an object that the app informs of significant runtime events—for example, 
app launch, 
low-memory warnings, and 
app termination—giving it an opportunity to respond appropriately.

调用其它应用 openURL:
Apps can cooperatively handle a resource 
such as an email or an image file through the openURL: method. 
For example, 
an app opening an email URL with this method 
may cause the mail client to launch and display the message.

The programmatic interfaces of UIApplication allow you to 
manage behavior that is specific to the device. 
Use this object to do the following:

Control the app’s response to changes in interface orientation.
Temporarily suspend incoming touch events.
Turn proximity sensing (of the user’s face) off and on again.
Register for remote notifications.
Trigger the undo-redo UI (applicationSupportsShakeToEdit).
Determine whether an installed app can open a URL (canOpenURL:).
Extend the execution of the app so that it can finish a task in the background.
Schedule and cancel local notifications.
Coordinate the reception of remote-control events.
Perform app-level state restoration tasks.

UIApplication defines a delegate 
that must 
adopt the UIApplicationDelegate protocol and 
implement some of the protocol methods.
