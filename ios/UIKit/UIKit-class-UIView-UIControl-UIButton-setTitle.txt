Sets the title to use for the specified state.

- (void)setTitle:(NSString *)title
        forState:(UIControlState)state

Use this method to set the title for the button. The title you specify derives its formatting from the buttonâ€™s associated label object. If you set both a title and an attributed title for the button, the button prefers the use of the attributed title over this one.

At a minimum, you should set the value for the normal state. 
If a title is not specified for a state, the default behavior is to use the title associated with the UIControlStateNormal state. 
If the value for UIControlStateNormal is not set, then the property defaults to a system value.
