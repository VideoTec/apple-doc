State Preservation and Restoration

If you assign a value to the view controller's restorationIdentifier property, 
the system may ask the view controller to encode itself when the app transitions to the background. 

When preserved, a view controller preserves the state of any views in its view hierarchy that also have restoration identifiers. 
View controllers do not automatically save any other state. 

If you are implementing a custom container view controller, 
you must encode any child view controllers yourself. 
Each child you encode must have a unique restoration identifier.
