Memory Management

Memory is a critical resource in iOS, and 
view controllers provide built-in support for reducing their memory footprint at critical times. 

The UIViewController class provides some automatic handling of low-memory conditions 
through its didReceiveMemoryWarning method, which releases unneeded memory.
