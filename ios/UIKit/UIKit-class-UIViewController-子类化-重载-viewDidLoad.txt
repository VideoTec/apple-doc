Called after the controller's view is loaded into memory.

This method is called after the view controller has loaded its view hierarchy into memory.
 
This method is called regardless of whether 
the view hierarchy was loaded from a nib file or 
created programmatically in the loadView method. 

You usually override this method to perform additional initialization on views that were loaded from nib files.
