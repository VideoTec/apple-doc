Creating a View
To create a view programmatically, you can use code like the following:

CGRect  viewRect = CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100);
UIView* myView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:viewRect];

This code creates the view and positions it 
at the point (10, 10) in its superview’s coordinate system (once it is added to that superview). 

To add a subview to another view, you use the 
addSubview: method. 

In iOS, sibling views may overlap each other without any issues, allowing complex view placement. 
The addSubview: method places the specified view on top of other siblings. 
You can specify the relative z-order of a subview by adding it using the 
insertSubview:aboveSubview: and 
insertSubview:belowSubview: methods. 

You can also exchange the position of already added subviews using the 
exchangeSubviewAtIndex:withSubviewAtIndex: method.

When creating a view, 
it is important to assign an appropriate value to the autoresizingMask property 
to ensure the view resizes correctly. 
View resizing primarily occurs when the orientation of your application’s interface changes 
but it may happen at other times as well. 
For example, calling the setNeedsLayout method forces your view to update its layout.
