The following methods are called when state transitions occur. 
For information about what to do in response to each transition, see the method descriptions:

Launch time:
application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:

Transitioning to the foreground—
applicationDidBecomeActive:

Transitioning to the background:
applicationDidEnterBackground:

resign[英][rɪˈzaɪn] [美][rɪ'zaɪn] v.辞职；放弃；屈从；勉强接受
Transitioning to the inactive state
applicationWillResignActive: (Called when leaving the foreground state.)
applicationWillEnterForeground: (Called when transitioning out of the background state.)

Termination:
applicationWillTerminate: (Called only when the app is running. This method is not called if the app is suspended.)

The specific tasks you perform during a given state transition are 
dependent upon your app and its capabilities. 
For tips and guidance about what to do during state transitions, see App Programming Guide for iOS.

------------------------------------
State Transitions - APP 运行状态
------------------------------------
One of the main jobs of the app delegate is to 
respond to state transitions reported by the system. 

For every state change that occurs, 
the system calls the appropriate methods of the app delegate. 

Each state has different rules 
that govern how the app should is expected to behave and 
the app delegate methods must adjust the behavior of the app accordingly. 

Table 1 lists the possible states of an app and the high-level expectations. 
Figure 1 shows how an app moves from one state to another.

状态有：

Not Running

Foregound 分成两个状态
Inactive  -  not receiving events
Active    -  receiving events

Background
An app in the background state should do as little work as possible. 

Suspended - The app is in memory but is not executing code.
