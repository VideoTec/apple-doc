drawRect: method
setNeedsDisplay or 
setNeedsDisplayInRect: method of the view.

The View Drawing Cycle

View drawing occurs on an as-needed basis. 
When a view is first shown, or 
when all or part of it becomes visible due to layout changes, 
the system asks the view to draw its contents. 

For views that contain custom content using UIKit or Core Graphics, 
the system calls the view’s drawRect: method. 
Your implementation of this method is responsible for 
drawing the view’s content into the current graphics context, 
which is set up by the system automatically prior to calling this method. 
This creates a static visual representation of your view’s content that can then be displayed on the screen.

When the actual content of your view changes, 
it is your responsibility to notify the system that your view needs to be redrawn. 
You do this by calling your view’s 
setNeedsDisplay or 
setNeedsDisplayInRect: method of the view. 
These methods let the system know that it should update the view during the next drawing cycle. 
Because it waits until the next drawing cycle to update the view, 
you can call these methods on multiple views to update them at the same time.

NOTE

If you are using OpenGL ES to do your drawing, 
you should use the GLKView class instead of subclassing UIView. 
For more information about how to draw using OpenGL ES, see OpenGL ES Programming Guide for iOS.
