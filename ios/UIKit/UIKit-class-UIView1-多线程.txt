Threading Considerations
Manipulations to your application’s user interface must occur on the main thread. 
Thus, you should always call the methods of the UIView class from code running 
in the main thread of your application. 

The only time this may not be strictly necessary is 
when creating the view object itself 
but all other manipulations should occur on the main thread.
