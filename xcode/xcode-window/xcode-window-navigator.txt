choose a file to view or edit its contents in the editor area.

Symbol navigator: 
Browse all the symbols in your project or just those within a scope that you specify.

Debug navigator:

Breakpoint navigator:

navigator 区域分成三段：
--------------------------
第一区：navigator bar

第二区：content area

第三区：filter bar
The filter bar lets you restrict the content that is displayed. 

For example, 

the project navigator has filters for 
recently edited files, 
files with source control status, unsaved files, and filename strings. 

The debug navigator has a slider for specifying how much stack information is displayed.
