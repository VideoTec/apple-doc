 Actually, I don't think it auto-adds. I think it always does commit -a. 
 Looking at git status on the command line shows me many new and modified files that are NOT staged. 
 But I'm sure if I committed with Xcode they'd all end up in that commit.

For those having this problem and using xcode 6 its much easier.
Preferences -> Source Control
and then uncheck "Enable Source Control" or just uncheck add and "Remove files automatically".
